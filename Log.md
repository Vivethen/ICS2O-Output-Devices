# Things I Have Learned
1-2 pargraphs

I learned a few things from my gallery walk. I learned that Linux is an open source operating system used to transfer and share files.
I also learned thatb input devices are used to absorb and save data onto devices like a computer or phone. Some examples of an input device
were a motherboard and the inner parts of a cell phone. I also learned many things on my own website. I learned that output devices are 
very importent for transfering files so we can see them or hear them. A headphone for example is an output device used to listen to 
some music in your phone or your input device.


# Things I Still Want To Learn
1-2 paragraphs

I still want to learn why chrome is used more often than other browsers like internet explorer. I also would like to know if there are ways
to transfer data immediatly from an input device to an output device. Are there ways that can increase the time it takes for something 
to load on a computer e.t.c.
